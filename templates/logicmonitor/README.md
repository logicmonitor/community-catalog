## About the collector
The collector is an application that runs on a server within your infrastructure and uses standard monitoring protocols to intelligently monitor devices within your infrastructure.  You should install a collector in each location of your infrastructure - one collector can typically monitor hundreds of devices, however, this capacity depends on how many metrics are being monitored for each device, as well as the available resources of the server on which the collector is installed.
